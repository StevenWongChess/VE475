# VE475

Welcome to VR475, a course offered by UMJI for juniors and seniors. Despite the VR title, this is a CS course if you believe in Trump. I collected some lecture notes with annotation on it. The secret to success in VR475 is to write essays carefully. If you did well in VY100 and VY200, no need to worry about this course. But you should notice that thi course counts for humanity, which means you have to fulfill another 3 credit in social science to graduate. Have a nice journey!
